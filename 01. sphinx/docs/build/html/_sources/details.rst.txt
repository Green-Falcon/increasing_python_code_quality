This is an extra file that I'm going to use
to show you how you can utilize multiple
files.


Take a look at the following code:


.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import numpy as np
    import tensorflow as tf
    import torch as t

    def function(a, b):
        a *= 10
        b += 5
        return a + b

.. _coding_section:

Coding Subsection
=================

You can run the following command in terminal:

.. note::

    Hello man?

.. _console_t:

.. code-block:: console

    (code_quality) H:\Mine> pip install tensorflow

The following ``function`` is something wonderful.

.. _coding_sec:

.. code-block:: python
    :lineno-start: 5
    :emphasize-lines: 1, 4, 2
    :caption: This is a
              very complex
    :name: complex_code

    def function(a, b):
        a *= 10
        b += 5
        return a + b

The above code is a very complicated function! You
cannot believe it man!

This is the third one.
