"""
Guessing Game
=============

Here is a typical docstring used in a **python** file.
`Bias Variance <https://biasvariance.ir/>`_ is a scientific website.

We want to have a guessing game. In this game, one player
considers a number in mind, and the other player tries to figure it out.
The first player will just tell the second player whether his guessed
number is more or less than the first player's kept number.

.. note::

    This is a very good game.

The :class:`main.PlayGame` class or :class:`game.main.PlayGame`
or :class:`!game.main.PlayGame` or :class:`~game.main.PlayGame`.

The :class:`main.PlayGame` class is responsible to run the game, and
consider that :class:`~game.main.PlayGame` class is a very important one.

.. math::

    (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

    (a - b)^2 = a^2 -2ab + b^2
